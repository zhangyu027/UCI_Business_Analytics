# UCI_Business_Analytics

This introductory analytics course starts with an overview of data analytics to introduce the different types of data and fundamental concepts behind collecting, storing, and analyzing data. A survey of the different types of analytics (descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive) will provide insight into how each type can be applied to derive the most benefit from available data. Use cases will be discussed to evaluate best practices and lessons learned.

Prerequisites
None.

Student Learning Outcomes
At the end of this course, students will be able to:

Develop actionable plans from existing corporate data and initiatives to evaluate the effectiveness of current strategies
Collect, select, describe, profile, and prepare data from various sources for analysis
